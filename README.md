 🚀 Managing Network Using SDN and NFV
---

 📌 About the Project

This project demonstrates a hybrid networking model by integrating **Software Defined Networking (SDN)** with **Network Function Virtualization (NFV)** to manage and optimize virtual ISP-level networks. It uses:

- 🛠️ **Mininet** for virtual topology
- 🌐 **OpenDaylight** as the SDN Controller
- ☁️ **OpenStack** for NFV services
- 🧠 **Custom Python Scripts** to enable NAT, routing, and service logic

## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### 🔧 Prerequisites
- Ubuntu 20.04 / 22.04 (Recommended)
- Git, Python3, Mininet, Open vSwitch
- POX or OpenDaylight Controller
- Optional: OpenStack for NFV

---

### 🛠️ Installation

```
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/sdn-nfv-project.git
cd sdn-nfv-project

# Run your custom topology
sudo python3 finaltopo.py
```

Make sure your SDN controller (like POX) is already running:

```
# Example: Starting POX controller
cd pox
./pox.py forwarding.l2_learning
```

---

## 🧪 Testing

Inside Mininet CLI:

```
pingall                      # Check host connectivity
xterm h1 h2                  # Open terminals for hosts
h1 wget google.com           # Test external access
```
